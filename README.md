### Hi there 👋


**I am Satvik, Working as senir electrical engineer in Larsen & Toubro ECC. 
Professionally I work on Battery Energy Storage System solutions (BESS).
Personally I am very much interested in Data, Data Cleaning, EDA, Algorithms, DSA** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning MySQL, Advanced Spradsheets, MySQL workbench
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine learning projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with EDA, feature engineering & feature selection
